# CLASS Omega-field Implementation

This directory contains modifications to the CLASS Boltzmann solver implementing the Omega-field theory.

## Features

- Conserved Omega charge in the cosmological background
- Stable linear perturbation equations
- Explicit reduction to ΛCDM in the weak-coupling limit

## Structure

- `modifications/`  
  Source-code changes implementing the Omega-field equations

- `run_examples/`  
  Example configuration files demonstrating:
  - ΛCDM-equivalent behavior
  - Clustering Omega-field regimes

This implementation is intended for research and validation purposes.
